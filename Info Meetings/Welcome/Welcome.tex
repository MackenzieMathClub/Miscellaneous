		\frametitle{What is Math Club?}
		Math Club has been totally revamped for this year, so prepare yourself for Math Club like you've never seen!

		We meet every Monday in \alert{this} room, room 227!
	\end{frame}
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{What does Math Club do?}
		Every week we will introduce a new concept and teach it.
		\pause
		
		We will always have worksheets to work on instead for any students who already know the topic, or for any students who are in a lower grade and don't have the prerequisite knowledge.
		\pause

		So if you're in grade 9 we don't expect you to follow along with a lesson requiring calculus, but you can certainly try!
	\end{frame}
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Guest lectures}
		We are introducing a new program to Math Club this year: guest lectures.
		\pause

		Are you really excited about something in math?
		\pause

		Want to discuss the latest discoveries in mathematics?
		\pause

		Then sign up to be a guest lecturer! We will work with you to design a lesson which you can teach at Math Club! And we made sure to give it a really fancy sounding title to put on your university applications.
	\end{frame}
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Sign up}
		You can now sign up for Math Club.

		Go to:
		\begin{center}
			\huge
			\url{mackenziemathclub.github.io}
		\end{center}
		And click on \alert{Join Math Club}
		\pause

		Once that is done, you can also click on \alert{Apply to be a guest lecturer}. This is a longer form, so we recommend that you do it at home. There is no rush to fill out the guest lecturer form, and it is completely optional.
